		"152": "Ever wanted an enchanted ring that turns rocks into slimes? Well neither did I.",
		"153": "Someone once told me friendship is magic. That's ridiculous. You can't turn people into frogs with friendship.",
		"154": "I can see your future now... You will buy a lot of items from me!",
		"155": "I once tried to bring an Angel Statue to life. It didn't do anything.",
		"156": "Thanks!  It was just a matter of time before I ended up like the rest of the skeletons down here.",
